# Projects

Projects are a showcase of things I have worked on. They exist in `/src/content/projects`.

Each project should follow this template:

```markdown
---
title: 'Project Name'
description: Project Description
publishDate: 'Current Date' (Use current date, not a placeholder)
repo: https://github.com/andrewmunro/project-repo (Optional - omit if no repository exists)
seo:
    image:
        src: '/project-name/project-image.ext'
        alt: Project preview description
---

![Project Image](/project-name/project-image.ext)

A high level summary about the project in first person, explaining what it does and why it was built.

## Description

- **Key Feature 1:** Brief description with personal context (e.g., "Primary coding and development server I use")
- **Key Feature 2:** Description highlighting benefits or cost savings (e.g., "I used to pay a fortune for VPS's. Now I can run multiple services for free")
- **Key Feature 3:** Practical aspects like form factor, power usage, reliability
- **Key Feature 4:** Always-on capabilities and accessibility

## Tech

- **Category:** [Technology Name](mdc:https:/link.com) for specific purpose and benefit
- **Platform:** Technology used for orchestration/management
- **Tools:** Supporting tools and utilities
- **Security:** Security technologies and access control
- **Architecture:** Overall approach and design philosophy

## Features

- **Primary Use Case:** Main functionality and accessibility
- **Technical Approach:** How the solution works technically
- **Management:** How it's operated and maintained
- **Security:** Security features and protections
- **Deployment:** How services are deployed and managed
- **Multi-Purpose:** Various use cases and capabilities

## Outcome and Future Improvements

Personal reflection on how the project has impacted workflow or solved problems. Should be written in first person and include specific benefits gained.

Future improvements should be honest and practical, including:
- Infrastructure as Code improvements
- Backup solutions (can be self-deprecating about current state)
- Monitoring and alerting
- Process improvements
```

**Notes for project creation:**
- Always use current date, not placeholder dates
- Repository field is optional - omit if no repo exists
- Write in first person with personal context
- Include cost savings or practical benefits where relevant
- Be honest about current limitations in future improvements
- Create corresponding `/public/project-name/` directory for images
- Images should be saved as PNG or WebP format for better web performance

To create a new project, ask the user for general information about the project and try to fill in the template with their specific details.
