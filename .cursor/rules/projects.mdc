# Projects

Projects are a showcase of things I have worked on. They exist in `/src/content/projects`.

To create a new project, ask the user for various inputs.

Each project should follow this template:

```markdown
---
title: 'Project Name'
description: Project Description
publishDate: 'Jan 02 2024' (Today's date)
repo: https://github.com/andrewmunro/project-repo
seo:
    image:
        src: '/project-image.ext'
        alt: Project preview
