## SUMMARY

Full-stack engineer and technical leader with over 12 years of experience delivering scalable, high-availability platforms in the gambling and iGaming space. I specialise in cloud-native distributed systems, platform architecture, and technical strategy, with a strong track record of leading cross-functional engineering teams through complex initiatives—ranging from greenfield builds to large-scale platform transformations. I bring hands-on expertise across the stack (both frontend and backend) and a pragmatic, delivery-focused mindset rooted in real-world operations and stakeholder engagement. Comfortable operating at both strategic and implementation levels, I excel at aligning technology with product vision, shaping architectural direction, and fostering engineering culture in fast-paced, regulated environments.
