This is my cat Laika, [named after the first dog to orbit the earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika) ðŸš€. 

My Latvian friend suggested this was a poor name for a cat, since it translates roughly as "barker" in Russian. That being said, she is constantly following me around meowing, so I think it's a good fit.
